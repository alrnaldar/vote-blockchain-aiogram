           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

#### Version status:
* v2.x - actual release, supports aiogram v3.x
* v1.x - old release, supports aiogram v2.x, critical fix only

### About 
`aiogram-dialog` is a framework for developing interactive messages and menus in your telegram bot like a normal GUI application.  
 
It is inspired by ideas of Android SDK and other tools.

Main ideas are:
* **split data retrieving, rendering and action processing** - you need nothing to do for showing same content after some actions, also you can show same data in multiple ways. 
* **reusable widgets**  - you can create calendar or multiselect at any point of your application without copy-pasting its internal logic  
* **limited scope of context** - any dialog keeps some data until closed, multiple opened dialogs process their data separately

Designing you bot with `aiogram-dialog` you **think about user**, what he sees and what he does. Then you split this vision into reusable parts and design your bot combining dialogs, widows and widgets. By this moment you can review interface and add your core logic. 

Many components are ready for use, but you can extend and add your own widgets and even core features. 

For more details see [documentation](https://aiogram-dialog.readthedocs.io) and [examples](example)

### Supported features:
* Rich text rendering using `format` function or `Jinja2` template engine. 
* Automatic message updating after user actions
* Multiple independent dialog stacks with own data storage and transitions
* Inline keyboard widgets like `SwitchTo`, `Start`, `Cancel` for state switching, `Calendar` for date selection and others. 
* Stateful widgets: `Checkbox`, `Multiselect`, `Counter`, `TextInput`. They record user actions and allow you to retrieve this data later. 
* Multiple buttons layouts including simple grouping (`Group`, `Column`), page scrolling (`ScrollingGroup`), repeating of same buttons for list of data (`ListGroup`). 
* Sending media (like photo or video) with fileid caching and handling switching to/from message with no media. 
* Different rules of transitions between windows/dialogs like keeping only one dialog on top of stack or force sending enw message instead of updating one. 
* Offline HTML-preview for messages and transitions diagram. They can be used to check all states without emulating real use cases or exported for demonstration purposes. 


### Usage

Example below is suitable for aiogram_dialog v2.x and aiogram v3.x

#### Declaring Window

Each window consists of:

* Text widgets. Render text of message.
* Keyboard widgets. Render inline keyboard
* Media widget. Renders media if need
* Message handler. Called when user sends a message when window is shown
* Data getter functions (`getter=`). They load data from any source which can be used in text/keyboard
* State. Used when switching between windows

**Info:** always create `State` inside `StatesGroup`


```python
from aiogram.filters.state import StatesGroup, State
from aiogram_dialog.widgets.text import Format, Const
from aiogram_dialog.widgets.kbd import Button
from aiogram_dialog import Window


class MySG(StatesGroup):
    main = State()


async def get_data(**kwargs):
    return {"name": "world"}


Window(
    Format("Hello, {name}!"),
    Button(Const("Empty button"), id="nothing"),
    state=MySG.main,
    getter=get_data,
)
```

### Declaring dialog

Window itself can do nothing, just prepares message. To use it you need dialog:

```python
from aiogram.filters.state import StatesGroup, State
from aiogram_dialog import Dialog, Window


class MySG(StatesGroup):
    first = State()
    second = State()


dialog = Dialog(
    Window(..., state=MySG.first),
    Window(..., state=MySG.second),
)
```

> **Info:** All windows in a dialog MUST have states from then same `StatesGroup`

After creating a dialog you need to register it into the Dispatcher and set it up using the `setup_dialogs` function:

```python
from aiogram import Dispatcher
from aiogram_dialog import setup_dialogs

...
dp = Dispatcher(storage=storage)  # create as usual
dp.include_router(dialog)
setup_dialogs(dp)
```

Then start dialog when you are ready to use it. Dialog is started via `start` method of `DialogManager` instance. You
should provide corresponding state to switch into (usually it is state of first window in dialog).

For example in `/start` command handler:

```python
async def user_start(message: Message, dialog_manager: DialogManager):
    await dialog_manager.start(MySG.first, mode=StartMode.RESET_STACK)

dp.message.register(user_start, F.text == "/start")
```

> **Info:** Always set `mode=StartMode.RESET_STACK` in your top level start command. Otherwise, dialogs are stacked just as they do
on your mobile phone, so you can reach stackoverflow error
